# GuessingGame

The Guessing Game Project is a three-part project. The user guesses a number between 1-100. The app responds and indicate if their guess is 'hot' or 'cold' based on how close the guess is to the number they are trying to guess. The game keep tracks of previous guesses, and give the user a way to reset the game, or get a hint.
